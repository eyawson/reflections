1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff actually made me see ashort cut I have been looking for for a while.
It make seeing differences in files a breeze. Instead of manually searching
piles of text using the diff command works wonders cutting your work time to
almost nil or negligible. Go diff!!!


2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It just lets you become daring to try new things and experimment with code
knowing that if something goes terribly wrong or does not work right there
are other previous versions to fall back on. Freedom of coding!!!


3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?


4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?


7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
