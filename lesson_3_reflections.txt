1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to have both because it means I can work local and also when I'm away. We are in an increasingly mobile world.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Then there wil be too many or uneccesary commits.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is making a clone of somebody else's repository but it only occurs in github. A clone is making an exact copy of a repo in your github.
